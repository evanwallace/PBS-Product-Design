These files are for a new safety door for the Perlini Bottling System. There is a directory with native Solidworks 2013 files and a directory with STEP files, along with an eDrawing of the entire product.


The only two files for which the surface finish is important are:

	Lower outside door strip
	Upper outside door strip

They should have a vertical brushed grain on outer surface, to match the valence piece (PBS_290 from last part set).


These two parts have very tight tolerances:


	lower inside door band and hinge
	upper inside door band - hinge- locking tongue

It is very important the U-shaped hinges be welded very precisely to the curved band, with a tolerance of +/- 0.02" up-down and side-to-side.

Can the screw holes on the upper and lower inside door bands be threaded for #4-40 machine screws?
